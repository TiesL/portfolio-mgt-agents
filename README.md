# Portfolio Management Agents

Part of the **Decision Velocity** proposition (Ties & Didier). This repository is the specification and starting point for building an agent-based portfolio governance system: a strictly linear, six-phase project lifecycle (Idea → Definition → Design → Realization → Go-Live → Closure) in which specialized advisor agents assess project documentation at each governance gate, and human decision-makers (Portfolio Board, Steering Group) retain all Go/No-Go authority.

This is a specification-first repository. No application code exists yet — the intent is to open this repo in Claude Code (Plan Mode recommended for the first pass) and use these documents as the brief for scoping and building the system.

## Start Here

1. **[`docs/prd/PRD.md`](docs/prd/PRD.md)** — the product requirements document: problem, goals, non-goals, system overview, and links into everything else. Read this first.
2. **[`docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`](docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md)** — every product/architecture decision made so far, with options considered and rationale. Treat this as binding unless a new entry supersedes one.
3. **[`docs/decisions/roles-and-personas.md`](docs/decisions/roles-and-personas.md)** — the 11 human roles across 4 governance tiers who use this system.
4. **[`docs/prd/agent-specifications.md`](docs/prd/agent-specifications.md)** — full behavioral specification for each of the 6 advisor agents.
5. **[`docs/prd/project-lifecycle-flow.md`](docs/prd/project-lifecycle-flow.md)** — the 6-phase lifecycle, gates, and decision criteria.
6. **[`templates/execution-templates.md`](templates/execution-templates.md)** — the actual Markdown templates (project idea, brief, PID, PSA, status report, go/no-go, change request, closure, etc.) the agents assess against and that end users fill in.
7. **[`docs/diagrams/`](docs/diagrams/)** — visual flowchart of the lifecycle (Mermaid source + rendered HTML).

Didier's original Dutch-language field documents (RTF/DOCX/PPTX) that this system's roles and templates were aligned against are deliberately **not** in this repo — not needed going forward, and not appropriate to publish. If a template needs to change, change `templates/execution-templates.md` and log why in the Decision Log.

## Key Constraints (do not violate without a new Decision Log entry)

- **Strictly linear governance.** No phase-skipping, no exception paths. The only flexibility mechanism is looping back to an earlier phase. (DEC-002 REVISED)
- **Humans decide, agents assess.** No agent has Go/No-Go authority in Release 1.0. (DEC-001)
- **Role descriptions are functional, not job titles.** The system must work for organizations of any size — a small org may combine several roles into one person. (DEC-003)
- **English + Markdown, role-aware, checkbox/fill-in-the-blank format** for all templates, even though the source materials from Didier are in Dutch and Word/PowerPoint. (DEC-004)
- **No client-identifying examples** (e.g. the Feyenoord references present in Didier's original source RTF) in anything we produce.

## Updating the Decision Log

If a design or scoping decision is made while working in this repo — including ones proposed by an agent and approved by a human — add a new dated entry to `docs/decisions/DECISION-LOG.md` rather than editing history. If a decision supersedes an earlier one, mark the earlier entry "Superseded by Entry N" (see Entry 2 for the pattern) rather than deleting it.

## Relationship to the Wider Decision Velocity Proposition

Decision Velocity has two building blocks operating at different cadences:

- **Portfolio Management Agents** (this repo) — the portfolio cycle.
- **Software Development Workflow Agents** (separate system, not in this repo) — the product/release/sprint/day cycle. That system is intentionally *non-linear* (looping, exception paths, phase-skipping are all permitted there), which is the opposite of this system's strictly linear model — don't import assumptions from one into the other.

Integration/handoff points between the two systems are a known, deliberately deferred gap.
